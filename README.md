iplayer-dl in C#
================

It's very basic, but it works.

Building
--------

You'll need `HTMLAgilityPack.dll` (from [here] [hap]) in the `lib` directory,
rake, and the Mono toolchain. It should be possible to build it using
Microsoft's tools, too, but you'd need to set up the build process from
scratch.
